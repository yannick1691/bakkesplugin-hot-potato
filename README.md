## What is Hot Potato
Hot potato is a practice drill inspired by [SpookLuke](https://youtu.be/1ggYEBQyiRk?t=250), where the goal is to let the ball bounce but not let it bounce more then twice.

This plugin adds a overlay that shows how often the ball has bounced since the last time, your current streak and the high score of the current session.

While the purpose of a practice drill isn't to reach a high score, it can be nice to see how well you are doing and be able to have a metrics to compare to over a period of time.

## Using the plugin
To use the plugin head over to the plugins section, then head over to the Hot Potato section.

Then press the `Toggle Hot Potato overlay` button, which will show a small overlay showing how often the ball has bounced, your current streak and highscore of the active session.

You can also add a custom keybind to open this menu `togglemenu HotPotato`
